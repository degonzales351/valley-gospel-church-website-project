<h1>Become a part of our community</h1>
<p>Welcome to Valley Gospel Tabernacle our goal is to make the community feel at home and provide a foundation that is centered around Christ.</p>
<h2>1 John 1:3</h2>
<p>That which we have seen and heard declare we unto you, that ye also may have fellowship with us: and truly our fellowship [is] with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2>Persona</h2>
<p>James Thompson</p>
<p>Age 29</p>
<p>Occupation General Manager</p>
<p>Frustration: James is a regular church goer who would like to know more about service times and upcoming events happening at Valley Gospel Tabernacle</p>
<p>James has a very busy schedule and would like to fit in time to participate in church events but has no way of finding out about times and event schedules because Valley Gospel Tabernacle doesnt have a way of informing the community and are in need of a website.</p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>James would like to see a change in the church moving towards using a website in order to connect the busy community to having a way of participating in church events/activities</p>
<h3>Pre conditions</h3>
<p> In order to accomplish this goal the church is going to have to invest in creating a website to be able to connect with the busy community</p>
